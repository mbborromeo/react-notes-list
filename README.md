# react-notes-list
React notes list with priority categorization and local storage.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Assumptions
I assume free-text notes can be multiple lines during input, so am attempting to keep track of linebreaks when saved, but not formatting.

Local Storage is on web-browser.

## To Do
- If no changes upon editing a note, then let user know and don't save
- Redirect to list view (homepage) after saving on edit
- Replace alert() with dynamic text in div
- Fix CSS for Homepage so long notes are truncated with elipsis
- Setup Eslint for code consistency and checking React-Hooks rules
- Live search on content
- Implement prop-types or Typescript

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the React app on your local machine.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Note: You need to run this before predeloy/deploying to GitHub Pages.<br />
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run predeploy`

To pre-deploy React build for GitHub Pages

### `npm run deploy`

To deploy build files to GitHub Pages branch on origin.  Then you need to update the repository Settings to point to your build files, so it becomes a live site.
